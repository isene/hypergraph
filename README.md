Graphing HyperListS

This program creates a graphical representation of a HyperList. A HyperList can be used to describe anything â€“ any state or any transition - from a todo or shopping list to organizational structures, project plans, business processes or complex logic structures. It represents data in tree-structure lists with a very rich set of features.
