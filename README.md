Graphing HyperListS

This program creates a graphical representation of a HyperList. A HyperList can be used to describe anything â€“ any state or any transition - from a todo or shopping list to organizational structures, project plans, business processes or complex logic structures. It represents data in tree-structure lists with a very rich set of features.

To add colors ([all colors usable by Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/colors.html#x11)) to each node in the graph, add them in separate parenthesis at the end of each item like this:

`An example item (color=red) (fillcolor=blue) (fontcolor=white)`
